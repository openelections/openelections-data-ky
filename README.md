# openelections-data-ky
Pre-processed results for Kentucky elections

Almost all of the results here are converted from PDFs, mostly posted by the [State Board of Elections](https://elect.ky.gov/results/2010-2019/Pages/default.aspx). Many of these files are marked or labeled as unofficial, but in checking with county clerks we've found that they in fact represent official results. Some counties post their own precinct results and a few use Clarity Elections software to post results (the state also uses Clarity for [unofficial election night results](https://results.enr.clarityelections.com/KY/)).

Help us turn PDF files into data! We're looking for volunteers to [convert county-level results](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-ky/issues/1).
